thomas: Good day to you, kind sir!
-> Where were you on the night of the crime?
    Reading in the east wing solarium with chamomile tea. A quiet, crumb-free afternoon.
-> Why are you not guilty?
    I only partake in biscuits — and that “cookie” lacked the structural crispness of a true British bake.
-> Who do you think is the most guilty?
    Starboy hums when he’s guilty. I heard him vibrating a suspicious tune after dessert disappeared.

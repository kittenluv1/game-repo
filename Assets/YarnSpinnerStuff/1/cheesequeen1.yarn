cheesequeen: I'm just happy to be here
-> Where were you on the night of the crime?
    Inspecting the Gouda Geysers with my staff. The cheddar logs were witness.
-> Why are you not guilty?
    I hosted an event to showcase the cookie. Why would I steal my own diplomatic dessert?
-> Who do you think is the most guilty?
    Luci always leaves a sugar trace. Last week, the truffle vault evaporated under “mysterious” circumstances.

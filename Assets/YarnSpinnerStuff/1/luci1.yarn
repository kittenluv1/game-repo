luci: I honestly just want to find the culprit so we should work together
-> Where were you on the night of the crime?
    In my dream cauldron, testing sleep potions. I think. Possibly also in three places at once.
-> Why are you not guilty?
    I only eat cookies on blood moons. This wasn’t one. If it were, I’d have taken all of them.
-> Who do you think is the most guilty?
    Starboy had residual cocoa particles in his orbit. But then again… so did Thomas’s hat.

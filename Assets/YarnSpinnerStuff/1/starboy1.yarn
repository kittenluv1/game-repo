starboy: Stellar greetings, explorer of the cosmos!
-> Where were you on the night of the crime?
     Orbiting the Lagrange Point between Mars and Mood-Nibula 7. Prime starbathing hours.
-> Why are you not guilty?
   My kind consumes only plasma and the occasional philosophical concept. A cookie? Too... chewy.
-> Who do you think is the most guilty?
    Cheese Queen had frosting on her royal scepter. Strange for someone who “only eats savory.”

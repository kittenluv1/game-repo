thomas: Thinking about something?
-> Where were you on the night of the crime?
    Probably gambling, probably something awesome. You can’t ever predict something from a guy so cool! 
-> Why are you not guilty?
    Me? I’m not guilty because everyone in this room is way more guilty than I am! Haha!
-> Who do you think did the crime?
    Luci looks like she might have magic to make the moon small for easy stealing! Does this remind you of someone in particular? HAH!

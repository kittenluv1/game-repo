cheesequeen: You must be out of your mind.
-> Where were you at the time of the crime? 
    I was sitting on my throne, where I was expected to be... do you even know who I am?
-> Why are you not guilty? 
    My gouda, of all crimes... how dare you accuse a lady of something so preposterous!
-> Who do you think is the most guilty?
    Those who are most quick to accuse are always those who have something to cover up...
